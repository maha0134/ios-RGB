# ios-RGB
A native iOS application written using SwiftUI that allows users to convert RGB color values to Hex and vice-versa. 
Some main features of the app:
- Sliders to set Red, Green, Blue and Opacity values and see changes being reflected in the color preview.
- Enter Hex values and see preview as well as the RGB equivalent. 
- Text input restricted to Hex Alphabets(A-F) and digits.
- 3-digit, 4-digit, 6-digit as well as 8-digit Hex inputs accepted.
- Error handling in place for any other input range or empty input.
- Using Size classes to support Portrait and landscape mode on iPhones as well as iPads.
- Built using the MVVM architecture to keep code modular and the views clean.
